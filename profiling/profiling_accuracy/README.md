#Profiling accuracy

The ```total_time.py``` script demonstrate the profiling accuracy : it compares
the total analysis time for a given CTU to the cumulated times for the analysis of
every CU for this CTU.

Figure 1 shows the histogramms of both total and cumulated times.

Figure 2 shows the error histogramms.

The error is around 1% so the profiling data is quite reliable.
